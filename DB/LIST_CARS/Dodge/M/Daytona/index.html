					<h2 align="center"> HISTORY</h2>
					<article>
Introduction: The Dodge Daytona was born out of the desire to make the Charger more competitive on the NASCAR high speed tracks. In 1969, Dodge took its sucessful Dodge Charger, added a few aerodynamic pieces, and introduced the Charger 500 both on the NASCAR tracks and in showrooms. Shortly afterwards, Ford introduced its Torino Talladega and the Mercury Cyclone Spoiler which were aerodynamically superior to the Dodges and won on the tracks. The Dodge engineers went back to the drawing boards, and came up with the Daytona, designed to bring NASCAR glory back to the Dodge boys.

1969 Dodge Daytona

 The Dodge Daytona was created in 1969 with the sole purpose of winning aerodynamic supremacy for Dodge on the NASCAR tracks. Up front, the Daytona sported a pointed 18 inch nose extension made of fiberglass which reduced drag and enhanced downforce. Front fender-top scoops were added for tire clearance. Out back, the Daytona retained the 500â€™s recessed backlight but added a massize two-foot high rear spoiler. In order to race the Daytona in NASCAR, Dodge had to sell 500 units to the public. Priced at $4,000, the Daytonas were available with either the 440 or the 426 Hemi and 503 examples were eventually sold. One Lemon Twist Yellow Daytona has been documented with a dealer installed 440 Six Pack V8, but that was not a factory option. Daytonas, however, weighed almost 300 pounds more than regular Chargers with the same engines, and thus their performance on the street was slightly worse. But on the NASCAR tracks, they were unstopable. Bobby Isaac drove a Daytona sponsored by K&K Insurnace to a world record closed-course speed record of 201.104 mph. At the Daytona race that year, Dodge Daytonas swept the top four spots. At Bonneville, Isaac set an unlimited class speed record of 217 mph. And all of this performance was available at your friendly neighborhood Dodge dealer. This was truly the height of the performance mania. Sadly, 1969 would be the only year that the Dodge Daytona would be available, although Plymouth would try the same thing for 1970 with their Superbird.
