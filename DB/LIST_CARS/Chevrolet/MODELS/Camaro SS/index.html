					<h2 align="center"> HISTORY</h2>
					<article>
(1967-1969)
						Introduction: After two years of watching the Ford Mustang enjoy tremendous success, General Motors finally launched its entry into the pony car segment, the Chevrolet Camaro. Although available with a mediocre six cylinder for volume sales, the Camaro could be equipped with several V8s and a myriad of performance options. Then, of course, was the famous Regular Production Code, Z/28, that would change the industry’s view of pony cars.

1967 Chevrolet Camaro

 Inspired by the success of the Ford Mustang, Chevrolet launched its own pony car, the Camaro. Chevrolet stated that the “Camaro” was named after the French word for “comrade,” although some linguists argued that it was actually Spanish for a type of shrimp. Not exactly an awe aspiring name for a new pony car. Luckily, the Camaro had the muscle to back up its case. The Camaro was based on the upcomming 1968 Chevy Nova platform, and featured a unibody structure from the windshield and firewall back, with a separate steel rail subframe for everything up front. The Camaro was available from the start in hardtop coupe and covertible body styles, and could be order with nearly 80 factory options and 40 dealer accessories, including three main option packages and a choice of four different engines. The RS package included numerous cosmetic changes including a blacked out grill with hidden headlights, revised parking and tail lights, upgraded interior trim, and RS badging. Of greater interest to enthusiasts was the SS package which included as standard equipment a modified 350 cid V8 (the first 350 engine Chevy ever offered) with an available 396 cid big block producing 325bhp (L35) and later a 375bhp version, along with simulated air-intakes on the hood, special bumble bee striping, and a blacked out grill. It was possible to order both the RS and SS packages, and get a RS/SS Camaro, in which case the RS badging took precedence. Camaro popularity soared when a RS/SS Convertible with the 396 paced the 1967 Indianapolis 500 race.

In December 1966, Chevrolet then quietly released one of the most famous options codes of all time, option Z-28. Unpublicized and unknown by most of the buying public (and most Chevrolet sales people for that matter) and not mentioned in any sales literature, the only way someone could order the Z-28 package was to order a base Camaro with the Z-28 option, mandatory front disc brakes with power assist, and the Muncie 4-speed transmission. You could not order the SS package, automatic transmission, air conditioning, or the convertible. What you got was a unique 302 cid small block (Non-California emission cars were labeled MO while California emission engines were labeled MP) that was created by taking the 327 block and installing the short-stroke 283 crank. Specifically designed to compete in the Club of America Trans Am racing series which placed a 305 cid limit on its entries, the Z-28 was available to the public solely to qualify the car for racing. Advertised horsepower was listed at just 290bhp, which was not very impressive until one hooked it up to a dyno and got actual readings of 360-400 bhp. The Z-28 also came with a competition suspension, broad racing stripes on the hood and trunklid and could be combined with the RS option package. There was no Z-28 badging at all, lest it attract to much attention. The Z-28 proved to be difficult to launch on the street because its high reving engine was lethargic under 4000rpm and worked best when it was shifted at 7500rpm (!). Once it got going, the Z28 was tough to beat and boosted a 140mph top speed and numerous racing victories. Only 602 Z-28s were sold in 1967, making it a truly desirable collectable.

1968 Chevrolet Camaro

  The 1968 received minor changes for its second year. The grill took on a more horizontal look while the vent windows were dropped and “Astro Ventilation” (i.e. flow-through ventilation) was added. Side marker lights were added while the SS396 received revised chromed hood inserts (the SS350s stayed with the 1967 styling). Underneath, the 1967 Camaros pesky axle tramp was cured by the addition of multi-leaf rear springs to replace the single-leaf units and rear shock absorbers were now staggered. A new 350bhp 396cid option for the SS was added, while the Z-28 option (now just labeled MO) actually received some publicity and sold 7,199 units. The Z-28s were now easier to spot as they sported Z-28 or 302 badges.

1969 Chevrolet Camaro

  1969 saw several noteworthy changes to the Camaro. The grill became deeper set, the taillamps were longer and thinner and broken into three segments. A heavy “eye-brow” crease was added on the both sides of the car extending from the front wheel well to the rear wheel well. A matching crease went from the rear wheel well to the rear quarter panel. The Camaro also received new fenders, door skins, rear quarter-panels, grille and taillights which gave it a wider, lower appearance. Inside, the Camaro received a redesigned dash and more comfortable seats. Endura rubber bumpers were available on the Camaro as well as two ram air induction systems for the SS. The first was a new special hood with a rear facing inlet and cold-air duct underneath the hood. The second was a dealer installed cowl plenum kit that came with a special air cleaner and adapter. No special hood was needed. 1969 saw an explosion in engine choices. On the low-performance side, a new 307 V8 (a 327 crank in a 283 block) rated at 200bhp was added and a new 350 V8 rated at 255 bhp replaced the more powerful 327 engine. The Z28 continued with its seriously under-rated 302 (now called DZ) engine. The RS package was still popular, and included a special grill with concealed headlights (of a ribbed design) and washers, chrome wheel well moldings, drip rails, pinstripes, and RS badging. The SS standard 350 received a slight power boost to 300 bhp while the 396 engines continued in 325/350/375 bhp versions. Once again, a white RS/SS convertible with the 396 engine paced the Indianapolis 500 race, and Chevy offered replica versions as white convertibles with orange stripes and orange houndstooth upholstery (though most replicas were powered by 350 engines. Because of their collectibility, there are many “fake” 1969 Pace Car replicas out in the collector market so be careful if you are planning on buying one.

But real performance is more than special upholstery and the big news for 1969 was the availability of special 427 cid V8 equipped Camaros. The first were special dealer-installed units, most notably the Yenko Camaro 427. Yenko Sports Cars, based in Pennsylvania, along with other Chevy dealers such as Nickey in Chicago, Dana in California, and Baldwin-Motion in New York, would install the L72 427 cid block, rated at 425bhp by Chevrolet, ordered under the Central Office Production Order System (COPO) code 9562 into a buyer’s Camaro. The Yenko Camaro 427 is a typical example: it came from the factory with no ornamentation, badging, and the 427 engine in a crate. Yenko installed the 427 block, changed the rating to a more realistic 450bhp, and added 15-inch rally wheels, bigger front roll bar, and sYc (Yenko Sports Car) badging. A full complement of racing add ons were available and sub 13 second quarter miles were possible with a few more dollars.

Overshadowing these dealer modified Camaros was the factory Camaro ZL1. Specially designed to compete in the NHRA Super Stock drag classes, Chevrolet made it an option under the COPO system (code 9560). The cars began as SS396/375bhp Camaros with the F41 suspension. The SS trim and engine were deleted, and the 427 engine, cowl-induction hood, front disc brakes, a choice of heavy duty 4 speed transmissions or Turbo Hydra-matic, and a 4:10 posi axle were added. But instead of the regular iron-block and head L72 found in the dealer installed Camaros, the ZL1 sported aluminum heads and the first aluminum block ever made by Chevrolet. It shared the L88 aluminum head/iron block’s engine rating of 430 bhp but made closer to 500 bhp — making it probably the most powerful engine Chevrolet ever offered to the public. And the engine weighed just 500 pounds, the same as Chevy’s 327 small block. The car was blessed with a 5 year/50,000 mile warranty and was fully street legal. With factory exhausts and tires, it turned low 13s; with headers and slicks, it could turn 11.6s @ 122mph. This was the fastest car ever produced by Chevrolet. Performance had its price — $4,160 for the ZL1 engine alone pushing the price of the Camaro ZL1 to an unbelieveable $7,200 (about double the price for a SS396 Camaro). Chevy needed to build 50 to qualify the car for racing, and in the end built 69 Camaros and 2 Corvettes with the ZL-1 engine. Their high price made them difficult to sell and at least 12 engines were removed and about 30 cars were returned back to Chevrolet. It took until the early 1970s to sell them all. One can only wonder what they are worth today.
<br/>
Production of the 1969 Camaros continued into the beginning of 1970 as the all new 1970 Camaros were not released until mid 1970. To add to the confusion, some late 1969 cars were titled as 1970 models.

Second Generation
1970-1981
<br/>
chevrolet-camaro-1b

Introduction: After just three years, Chevrolet released their second generation model halfway through the 1970 model year. This generation would last over 12 years and would see the once mighty Camaro become strangled by crash and emission standards.

Note: All engine ratings for 1970-1971 are in SAE Gross figures. All engine ratings for 1972+ are in SAE Net figures.

1970 Chevrolet Camaro
  Despite ominous predictions of the collapse of the pony car market, and development delays, the new Camaro was released with much fanfare and much success late in the 1970 model year. Most of the credit went to the new styling, which was European-inspired (some would say “Ferrari inspired”) and would prove so popular that it would last until 1982. Still based on the Nova, the new Camaro was two inches longer and had five inch longer doors, and was now available only as a coupe (no convertible). It featured a new A-arm front suspension and better noise insultation. Under the hood, the proposed new 454 blocks never made it and the Camaro SS continued with the 350 and 396 engines. After January 1970, however, the 396 engines no longer displaced 396 cubic inches. Chevrolet actually enlarged them to 402 cubic inches but the executives decided to name it the 396 to take advantage of the name recognition and avoid any attention from insurance carriers. The RS option now included a free standing grill, twin bumperetes, an Endura rubber grill frame, and parking lights between the headlights and the grill. The SS option included a special black grill, hidden wipers, power brakes, engine trim, white-letter tires, chrome dual exhausts, and the SS396 also came with black-painted trunk panels and a special suspension.

The Z28 saw the most radical change — an all new 350 cid engine know as the LT-1 350. It was rated at 360bhp (it had a rating of 370bhp when installed in Corvettes). This engine proved much more tractable, reliable, and generally outperformed the 302 engine of old. It was also available with an automatic transmission, the first time for the Z28.

1971 Chevrolet Camaro

  On the outside, the 1971 Camaro differed from the 1970 model mainly with the change to a high back seat with integrated headrest design. Under the hood, however, there were big changes. General Motors had decreed that all its cars for 1971 had to run on unleaded gasoline and this meant a drop in compression ratios and a big drop in power ratings. The Z-28 saw its 350 cid engine drop from 11:1 compression to 9:1 (which was still above the GM mandate of 8.5:1, but GM let it slide) and horsepower dropped to 330bhp from 360bhp. A new three piece rear spoiler for the Z-28 didn’t quite make up for the decrease in performance. Both the SS350 and SS396 (still with a 402 cid engine) saw decreases in power ratings and a proposed 400 cid engine never saw production. The RS package was still available with corresponding trim and appearance changes.

1972 Chevrolet Camaro

  A 174 day strike at the Ohio plant where all Camaros and Firebirds were built severly limited 1972 model year production. Even worse, 1,100 unfinished Camaros had to be scrapped because they didn’t meet 1972 federal bumper safety standards. With the declining performance market, there were many calls to cancel the Camaro. Luckily, cooler heads prevailed and the Camaro stayed in production. Visually, the 1972 Camaros had a revised grill with only seven vertical slats instead of the previous 12. Another GM mandate required that all power ratings be given in net terms (including all accessories). Although that led to drastic drops in peak numbers, the new ratings were actually more accurate than the old gross power ratings because they were a better reflection of the power that actually hit the road.

1973 Chevrolet Camaro
  The big news for 1973 was the deletion of the SS option and the 396 (actually 402) engine, which left only the Z-28 with its 350 V8 to carry the performance banner. The RS option was still available and included revised front bumperettes which met the new Federal 2.5mph regulations. A new Type LT option was added as a luxury package which included a weak V8 (L-65) and several trim items. The Z-28 saw another decrease in power as hydraulic lifters replaced its solid ones. As a sign of the times, air conditioning was available on the Z-28 for the first time. Despite all this, production for all models was up.

  To meet new Federal government bumper standards, the 1974 Camaro was redesigned with thick aluminum front and rear bumpers. The only grille available (the special RS grille was dropped) was now shovel-shaped and the rear taillights wrapped into the fenders. Engines and trims continued from the year before except for the addition of the LM-1, a special low emission (and less powerful) 350 V8 for cars sold in California to meet the state’s stricter emission standards.

1975 Chevrolet Camaro

  With extreme shortsightedness, Chevrolet eliminated the Z28 model for 1975. Maybe it was to save it from the utter embarrasement that the year’s engine choices would bring. The Camaro was now powered by only three catalyst-equipped engines, a 250 L6 rated at a pathetic 105bhp, a two-barrel 350 V8 rated at 145 bhp and a four barrel 350 rated at just 155 bhp. For some unknown reason, Camaros sold well this year.

The two barrel 350 was dropped to make way for an even weaker two-barrel 305 rated at 140bhp, while the four-barrel 350 received a power boost up to 165bhp.

1977 Chevrolet Camaro
 

  1977 saw a few changes (including intermittent wipers), but the big news was the return of the Z28 model, this time as a separate model (instead of as an option package as previously) even if it now stressed handling and appearance instead of power. The Z28 did handle well, even if it shared the same 350 4-barrel V8. But even in this sad state, the Camaro was more attractive than the hideous Ford Mustang II and the Camaro outsold the Mustang for the first time ever.

1978 Chevrolet Camaro

 
  Chevrolet added a new nose to the 1978 Camaro that got rid of the ugly metal bumpers and used an all new body color urethane front and rear fascia designed to meet the new 5 mph crash standard. The rear taillights were also redesigned, and incorporated 3 color lenses with the fuel door in the center. The Camaro now was available in five models, Sport Coupe, Rally Sport, Type-LT, Type-LT Rally Sport, and Z28. Translucent (i.e. smoked glass) T-tops were available on all models, while the Z28 received a full disco body package with front fender vents and a fake hoodscoop, and a more powerful 350 rated at 185bhp. But increasing emission regulation in California forced Chevrolet to offer separate engines for California and the rest of the nation. The Camaro outsold the Mustang II again.

Tighter emission controls resulted in slight drops in engine power across the Camaro’s extensive engine line-up. Still, a record 282,571 Camaros were sold for 1979, including a record 84,877 Z28’s, a feat that the Camaro would never top.

1980 Chevrolet Camaro
  Hoping to improve fuel economy, the 1980 Camaro featured an anemic engine line-up which included a new Chevy odd-fire 229 V6 rated at 115bhp (a Buick even-fire 231 V6 rated at 110bhp was available in California) which replaced the venerable and heavy L6 engines, and a new 267 V8 rated at a pathetic 120bhp. Power for Z28 models actually increased as the 350 V8 was rated at 190 bhp, except for California buyers who received a 305 V8 rated at 155bhp which was mated to a standard three-speed automatic (no manual transmission was available). Due to the fuel crisis, sales dropped dramatically to 152,005 units.

Third Generation

1982-1992

Introduction: The third generation Camaros would see the first Camaros with factory fuel injection, four-speed automatic transmission, five-speed manual transmissions, four-cylinder engines (yikes!), 16-inch wheels, and hatchback body styles.

1982 Chevrolet Camaro

  The third generation of Camaros debuted in 1982 as truly all new designs. They were the first Camaros built without front subframes or leaf-spring suspensions. The front end was now held up by MacPherson Struts and the rear used a long torque arm and coil springs. Engine choices were all new for 1982. At the bottom of the performance scale, buyers could order a Camaro with a version of GM’s “Iron Duke” 2.5 liter four cylinder engine rated at a pathetic 90 bhp. Engine options included a 2.8 liter V6 rated at 112 bhp (which was the base engine in the Berlinetta), or a four-barrel carbureted 5.0 liter (305 cid) small block V8 rated at 145bhp (which was the base engine in the Z28). Optional in the Z28 was a “Cross-Fire Injection” (Throttle Body-Injected) version of the 5.0 V8 which was rated at 165bhp. The carbureted 5.7 could be mated to a manual or automatic transmission, but the Cross Fire 5.7 was available with an automatic only. A 350 T-Top Camaro once again paced the Indianapolis 500 and the silver and blue replica cars are some of the most attractive of the 1982 models. It is sad to note, however, that the real pace car used a highly modified 350 V8 that wasn’t available to the public.

Hopefully, the digital instruments were more entertaining than the V6 that most Berlinettas had.

  Camaro made a big step forward in performance with the addition of a new model, the IROC-Z, which was named after the International Race of Champions, which pitted drivers all driving identical vehicles – in this case the Camaro. The IROC-Z featured big 16″ five-spoke wheels and unique graphics. Carbureted versions of the 5.0 were still available, but the big news was the addition of a Tuned Port Injection (TPI) version of the 5.7 for Z28 and IROC-Z models which was rated at a respectable 215bhp. Unfortunately, the TPI 5.7 was only available with the four speed automatic transmission. The Base Sport Coupe and Berlinetta had to make due with a new fuel injected version of the 2.8 V6 which was rated at 135bhp.

Using the TPI system, the 5.7 was rated at 225bhp, the most horsepower in a Camaro in 13 years, and had much better driveability. While the TPI 5.7 was only available with an automatic transmission, the TPI 5.0 was now available with a five-speed manual transmission. 1987 also saw the return of the convertible body style and the demise of the four cylinder engine. The High Output 5.0 engine was dropped and a new 5.0 V8 rated at 165bhp became the standard Z28 engine. The Berlinetta model was also dropped and was replaced by an “LT” option package. Camaros fitted with a rear spoiler had their CHMSL built into the spoiler, instead of on an ugly housing on the glass.

  Chevrolet decided to simplify things in 1988 and made the spoiler standard on all Camaros.

Base Camaros received the old 15″ five-spoke wheels from the Z28 as well the Z28’s lower body skirting. The Z28’s 5.0 V8 was now optional on the sport coupe, and it gained a throttle-body fuel-injection system to make 170bhp. IROCs could be ordered with the rare 1LE road racing package which included oversize disc brakes, an aluminum driveshaft and a tweaked suspension.

Lesser Camaros were pretty much unchanged from 1990, except for the addition of fake air inlets. A rare option was the Camaro B4C pursuit vehicle, which was available only to Law Enforcement agencies. The B4C was basically a Z28, badged as a RS, with some of the goodies of the 1LE race package.

Fourth Generation
1993-2002


Introduction: The fourth generation would be the greatest, and last, generation for the Camaro. These Camaros are, without a doubt, the fastest, most powerful Camaros ever built. But declining sales could not save them from cancelation after the 2002 model year.

1993 Chevrolet Camaro


  The Camaro was all new for 1993, the start of its fourth, and last, generation. All though most of the floor stamping and rear suspension was carried over, the 1993 Camaro featured new plastic front fenders, a new short-arm/long-arm front suspension, rack-and-pinion steering, and an all new sleek styling. The model lineup was simplified to just the base Sport Coupe powered by a 3.4 liter V6 rated at 160bhp and the Z28 with the Corvette’s 5.7 liter LT1 small-block V8 under-rated at 275 bhp. Once again, the convertible was gone. The LT1 was easily the most powerful small-block installed in a Camaro since its namesake, the 1970 LT-1 (note the dash), and, considering the change in gross vs. net ratings, may have been more powerful. The Z28 could be ordered with either a four-speed automatic or six speed manual transmission, and came standard with 16 inch wheels and tires, four wheel anti-lock brakes, and a black colored roof, standard. Z28 prices started at less than $17,000, making it a true performance bargin. Once again, a Camaro paced the Indianapolis 500 and black replica cars were offered. Unlike 1982, no modifications were necessary on the actual pace car.

In celebration, the RS name reappeared as a spoiler and ground effects package on the base Sport Coupe. Meanwhile, the Z28 saw its V8 jump to 285bhp. But the big news was the return of the SS. Chevrolet teamed up with SLP Engineering to bring back the SS name by taking the Z28 and adding engine tweaks and 17″ five-spoke wheels fitted with P245/40ZR17 BFGoodrick Comp T/A tires. The SS, with an impressive 305bhp rating, was the first Camaro to break the 300 net bhp barrier. To celebrate the Camaro’s 30th anniversary, Chevrolet offered a specially optioned white Z28 with orange stripes and orange houndstooth upholstery (just like the 1969 Pace car)

Changes were understandably minimal and included new sound systems, a standard automatic transmission for V6 convertibles, and a new power steering cooler for Z28s. But Chevrolet did celebrate the 35th (and last) anniversary of the Camaro with a special graphics package for the Z28 SS coupe and convertible. The stripes and logos of the 35th Anniversary package were attractive, but couldn’t keep the Camaro from being cancelled after the 2002 model year.
