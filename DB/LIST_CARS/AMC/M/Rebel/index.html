					<article>
AMC followed the success of its 1969 SC/Rambler with a new model for 1970, the Rebel “Machine.” The original concept of the “Machine” was of a basic black midsize coupe with black wheels, fat tires, and no stripes, scoops, or spoilers. The Rebel “Machine” debuted as a midsize coupe for 1970 but it was not basic black, but rather featured the outrageous Patriotic paint scheme featured on the SC/Rambler. Priced at $3,475, the Machine was based on the midsize Rebel platform and featured a 114 inch wheelbase and a curb weight of 3,640 lbs. Under the hood, AMC stuffed its 390 cid V8, now upgraded to 340 bhp. The engine breathed through a standard Ram-Air induction system which featured a huge hood scoop with a vacuum-controlled butterfly valve. A 8000 rpm lighted tachometer was integrated into a raised fairing on the scoop in front of the driver. A Hurst-shifted close ratio four speed transmission was mandatory and included a 3.54:1 axle. A low back pressure dual exhaust system, front and rear sway bars, a choice of either 3.54:1 or 3.91:1 rear axles, E60x15 white letter tires, styled wheels, and power disc brakes were standard. AMC’s limited-slip differential was a $43 option, with a genuine Detroit Locker and ratios up to 5.00:1 available. The Machine was one of the most stiffly sprung muscle cars. Its extra-heavy-duty suspension included firm station wagon rear springs, which elevated the tail and helped account for the raked look. Cornering ability was top-notch, but rear-axle juddering off the line prevented the willing, lightweight V8 from propelling the car into the low 14-second range. The first 1,000 cars were painted white and featured blue lower beltline stripes and hood, with red stripes on the upper body sides. At the rear, red, white and blue stripes ran across the fender tips and deck. Special “The Machine” emblems were tacked on the front fendersides and rear trim panel’s righthand sides. After the first 1,000 units, the Rebel Machine was made available in any color without the stripes. The original color scheme became a $75 option. In AMC tradition, The Machine lasted only one year.
