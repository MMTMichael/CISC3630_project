					<h2 align="center"> HISTORY</h2>
					<article>
By the early 1970s, the clouds were already on the muscle car horizon. Tightening government regulations and increasing insurance rates were making big block muscle cars expensive to own. AMC responded with its third, and last, one year performance model, the Hornet SC/360. The compact Hornet replaced the Rambler for 1970. It was efficiently sized with a 108 inch wheelbase and short 179.6 inch overall length. It was only 70.6 inches wide, despite having wheelwells that looked large enough to fit racing slicks. It was the perfect platform for a compact performance car. The original plans called for a SC/360 and a SC/401, but when AMC learned the 401 wouldn’t offer much of an insurance advantage, it shevled the idea. Priced at just $2,663, the base SC/360 came with the 360 V8 from the Javelin AMX. Also standard was rally stripes around the beltline, styled steel wheels with Polyglas D70x14s tires, three speed manual transmission, and reclining seats. The standard 360 engine had a two-barrel carb and a modest 245 bhp. Performance buyers could check off the $199 “Go” package which included a four barrel carb and a functional black hood scoop with a ram air setup for a more satisfying 285 bhp. Also included with the “Go” package was a handling package, raised-letter tires, and a tachometer. Optional was either a Hurst-shifted four speed manual or an automatic transmission, and a Twin-Grip differential with 3.54:1 or 3.90:1 gears. Although the SC/360 offered decent performance for a cheap price, only 784 were built, a small fraction of the total Hornet output.
