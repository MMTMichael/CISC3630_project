Introduction: The Dart was Dodge’s entry in the growing compact market. Introduced in 1960, the first generation Dodge Dart was actually just a small full-size car. It was “reborn” in 1963 as a true compact. The Dart lineup would continue to evolve, and included Demon and Swinger models as well as the Dodge Sport and the mighty Dart GTS.

1960 Dodge Dart

dodge-dart-1960a

  The Dodge Dart name first appeared as a radically aerodynamic show car in 1956. It returned four years later as a new downsized regular production vehicle. Featuring utilized body construction, and riding on a 118 inch wheelbase, it was four inches shorter than Dodge’s Polara flagship and thus was Dodge’s “compact” full-size model. The Dart was available as three models: Seneca, Pioneer, and Phoenix. Engine choices included a 318 cid V8 with either a two or four barrel carb, or a 361 cid V8 with 310 bhp. All three models were available with Dodge’s D500 performance option which included the 361 cid V8 with a new ram-induction setup which featured twin four-barrels on long, individual-runner intake manifolds which had a supercharger effect. This ram setup was also used on the larger 383 cid V8s used in Polara models, and a few Ram 383s found their way into the smaller Dart.

<br/> Production:
Engines: 318 V8 (2bbl) 230 bhp @ 4400 rpm, 340 lb-ft @ 2400 rpm. 318 V8 (4bbl) 255 bhp @ 4400 rpm, 345 lb-ft @ 2800 rpm. 361 V8 310 bhp @ 4800 rpm, 435 lb-ft @ 2800 rpm.
Performance: 361/310: 0-60 mph in 8 seconds.

1961 Dodge Dart

dodge-dart-1961a

  The D500 performance option was offered for the last time in 1961, but it was toned down from the year before. It now included a standard four barrel carb, or optional ram induction dual carbs (which were standard the year before).

<br/> Production: The 361 engine was slightly detuned for 1961, but that was overshadowed by the introduction of a new 383 cid V8 option, in either Police or Ram trim.
Engines: 318 V8 (2bbl) 230 bhp @ 4400 rpm, 340 lb-ft @ 2400 rpm. 318 V8 (4bbl) 260 bhp @ 4400 rpm, 345 lb-ft @ 2800 rpm. 361 V8 305 bhp @ 4800 rpm, 395 lb-ft @ 3000 rpm. 383 (Police) V8 325 bhp @ 4600 rpm, 425 lb-ft @ 3200 rpm. 383 (Ram) V8 330 bhp @ 4800 rpm, 460 lb-ft @ 2800 rpm.
Performance:

1962 Dodge Dart

dodge-dart-1962a

  1962 saw the peak of Dart performance when Dodge offered its 413 Max Wedge in all fullsize models, from the bare bones Dart 330 through the top of the line Polara 500. Most racers preferred the lighter and cheaper Darts. The 413 Max Wedge was manufactured under precise conditions at Chrysler’s Marine and Industrial Division and was a no-nonsense racing powerplant not intended for everyday operation. The 413 Max Wedge was offered in two forms: one with 11:1 compression rated at 410 bhp and the other with 13.5:1 compression rated at 420 bhp. The “Max” refered to the Maximum Performance label used in factory advertising while the “Wedge” refered to the 413’s Wedge shaped combustion chambers (as opposed to the earlier Hemispherical designs). Priced at just $374.40, the 410 bhp 413 was affordable and powerful. The Max Wedge featured free-flowing cast-iron headers, a dual exhaust system that featured cutouts that could be unbolted for unsilenced, wide open running. Heavy duty dual valve springs in the heads meant valve seals couldn’t be installed, making the engine a serious oil burner. The Max Wedge also featured a reinforced block and heads, a forged steel crank, Magnafluxed forged steel connecting rods, lightweight aluminum pistons, beefed-up valvetrain, and a deep-sump oil pan. Topping it off were two Carter AFB carbs mounted diagonally on a cross-ram intake featuring 15 inch individual runners.

As for styling, the Dodge Dart was all new for 1962, and sat on a 116 inch wheelbase, three inches shorter than a normal fullsize vehicle. Worse, Darts were saddled with some of the ugliest styling ever to be seen on an American vehicle. This would be the last year for a “fullsize” Dart as the name would be transfered to a true compact vehicle.

<br/> Production:
Engines: 318 V8 (2bbl) 230 bhp @ 4400 rpm, 340 lb-ft @ 2400 rpm. 318 V8 (4bbl) 260 bhp @ 4400 rpm, 345 lb-ft @ 2800 rpm. 361 V8 305 bhp @ 4800 rpm, 395 lb-ft @ 3000 rpm. 383 (Police) V8 325 bhp @ 4600 rpm, 425 lb-ft @ 3200 rpm. 383 (Ram) V8 330 bhp @ 4800 rpm, 460 lb-ft @ 2800 rpm. 413 Max Wedge V8 410 bhp. 413 Max Wedge V8 420 bhp.
Performance: 413/410 bhp: 0-60 in 5.8 seconds, 1/4 mile in 14.4 seconds @ 100 mph.

1963-1976

Introduction: The Dart was Dodge’s entry in the growing compact market. Introduced in 1960, the first generation Dodge Dart was actually just a small fullsize car. It was “reborn” in 1963 as a true compact. The Dart lineup would continue to evolve, and included Demon and Swinger models as well as the Dodge Sport and the mighty Dart GTS.

1963 Dodge Dart GT

dodge-dart-1963a

  The all new Dodge Dart switched to a 111 inch wheelbase and replaced the Lancer GT as Dodge’s sporty compact. The styling penned by Elwood Engle had a minimum of fussiness. The GT represented the top performing trim level, although the lack of a V8 was a puzzling omission for a “performance” car. The Dodge Dart was available as either a hardtop or convertible. Both had styling that featured prominent headlight bezels that protruded slightly from the fenders and grille, creating a look that resembled the Chrysler Turbine car. Styling was generally clean and smooth, with a thick angled rear pillar. All Darts were covered by a five year, 50,000 mile warranty.

1968 Dodge Dart GTS

dodge-dart-1968a

  Dodge introduced a new GTS trim for its Dodge Dart line to compete against Chevy’s Nova SS. The hot GTS was available with either a standard 340 cid V8 with 275 bhp or an optional 383 V8 with 300 bhp. Coupled with its light 3,000 pound curb weight, the Dodge Dart GTS did very well on the street and the track. Unfortunately, the extra weight of the 383 tended to negate the power advantage of the 383 over the 340. Furthermore, the 340 was rumored to actually produce over 300 bhp which helps explains the lack of improvement with the 383 engine. Other technical enhancements included a low-restriction exhaust system with chrome tips, Rallye suspension, 14×5.5 inch wheel rims and E70-14 Red Streak tires. A three-on-the-tree manual transmission was standard, though most GTS models were sold with either a four-speed Hurst floor shift manual or a competition-type Torque-Flite automatic transmission. Identifying the GTS were hood power bulges with air vents, body side racing stripes, special GTS emblems, and simulated mag wheel covers. A rear end “bumble bee” stripe was a no cost option. Vinyl bucket seats were standard in the $2,611 hardtop and optional in the $3,383 convertible.

But another option awaited those wanting even more performance. For a special few, Dodge shipped 383-spec Darts (minus Powertrain) along with factory prepped 440 engines to Hurst-Campbell, Inc., a Michigan after-market company. Hurst-Campbell did the conversion, Dodge reps inspected it, and the finished cars were forwarded to Grand Spaulding Auto Sales in Chicago, a performance-oriented dealer. These cars got vehicle identification numbers, but were not covered by the factory warranty. With even more weight over the front wheels and no power steering (it wouldn’t fit), the 440 Darts were only good for all out drag racing. Most modified 440 Darts also received additional performance parts such as aftermarket headers, ignition kit, hoses, wiring, and air cleaner.

As if that wasn’t enought, approximately 80 Darts were fitted with the 426 Hemi. But this wasn’t just a engine swap. They featured a fiberglass hood and front fenders, a front bumper and doors stamped out of a lighter gauge steel, special one-layer Corning Glass for the side windows (which did not meet DOT standards for use on public roads), no door window mechanisms, and no exterior side mirrors, all in an attempt to save weight. The weight saving measures continued inside with the deletion of the rear seat, the radio, and the replacement of the front seats with special lightweight van seats mounted on custom-fabricated aluminum mounting brackets. There was no insulation, no undercoating or sealers were used, and even the right side seatbelt was removed. Under the hood, the brake master cylinder was moved to clear the cylinder head, and rubber brake lines were used instead of metal so that they could be removed for access to the valve cover without disturbing the brake hydraulic system. The actual Hemi engine featured a pair of Holley carbs on a magnesium cross-ram intake. Iron heads (instead of aluminum) were used to keep the cost down. A heavy duty cooling package was standard, as well as headers, but the cars were delievered with no paint — just primer and naked black fiberglass from the cowl forward on cheap black wheels with skinny tires. Final cost per car was around $4,500, and to make sure that the cars were raced and NOT driven on public streets, every Hemi Dart came with a sticker that stated that “This vehicle was not manufactured for use on Public Streets, Roads or Highways, and does not conform to Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. But they definitely performed on the track, and would hit 10’s in the quarter miles with minimal modification. This would make it the fastest factory built car in muscle car history.

1969 Dodge Dart GTS

dodge-dart-1969a

  The 1969 Dart GTS sported some exterior changes and a more powerful optional engine. The exterior sported a new black grille with bright horizontal center bar, and a blacked-out rear body panel. Under the hood, the optional 383 V8 got the full Road Runner/Super Bee treatment and power increased to 330 bhp. Dodge strengthened the suspension when the 383 was ordered, increasing the diameter of the front torsion bars and front sway bars. But the same heavy-duty six-leaf rear springs and E70x14 tires were retained which made good launches tricky. Transmissions were shared as well, either a heavy-duty four speed or high-shift Torque-Flite, both with 3.23:1 gears standard and 3.55:1 or 3.91:1 available with the optional Sure Grip differential. Also new was a rear “bumble bee” stripe with a separate lower section and the GT Sport name written on it. The hardtop cost $3,226 and the convertible was $3,419.

Another specialty Dart was the Dart Swinger 340. Standard equipment included the 340 cid V8 with 275 bhp, four speed manual with Hurst shifter, three-spoke steering wheel with padded hub, Rallye suspension, “Swinger” bumble bee stripes and fat 14 inch wheels and tires. Seven exterior colors and four vinyl colors were available. All-vinyl upholstery (with full carpeting on four speed cars only) was included. The Swinger 340 was only available as a two-door hardtop for $2,836. Two axle ratios (3.55:1 and 3.91:1) were available.

1970 Dodge Dart GTS

dodge-dart-1970a

  The 1970 Dodge Dart lineup returned with Swinger 340 and Dart GTS trim lines. All Darts had new front and rear styling. The Swinger 340 was available for $2,808 but now included a three-speed manual as standard. Instead of smaller power vents, the hood now had two long, narrow hood scoops. Front disc brakes were included. Despite the introduction of the Dodge Challenger, the Swinger 340 still remained popular, selling 13,785 units. One reason for its popularity was that insurance companies classified it as a compact car and thus charged lower premiums than other muscle cars. The Swinger 340 was still fast and could often keep up with 340 equiped GTS’s.

1971 Dodge Demon 340

dodge-demon-1971a

  1971 saw the addition of the all new Dodge Demon to the Dart lineup. Based on the Plymouth Duster, it was a pillared two-door fastback with a 108″ wheelbase (three inches shorter than other Darts) and was available in two trims. The base Demon had the 198 cid I6 standard and minimal equipment, all for the bargin price of $2,343, just $30 more than the Duster. Performance minded buyers went for the Demon 340, the spiritual successor to the Dodge Dart GTS. The Demon 340 featured Chrysler’s strong 340 small block rated at 275 bhp. A three speed fully synchronized floor shift was standard, along with the Rallye instrument cluster, heavy-duty suspension, E70x14 rubber, stripes, and dual exhausts. Options included a dual-scoop matte-black hood complete with hood pins, rear spoiler, “Tuff” steering wheel, four-speed manual transmission, TorqueFlite automatic, or upgraded interior. At mid-year, the Demon Sizzler became available. Based on the base Demon, the Sizzler added some of the 340’s appearance and trim pieces. Both Demon models feature little cartoon “devil” decals which didn’t sit well with some religious groups, but definitely added to the Demon’s flair.
