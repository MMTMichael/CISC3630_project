					<article>
						(1964– 1973)

Introduction: The date was April 17, 1964. Intermediate sized muscle cars, with big block engines were gradually replacing the fullsized muscle car. Lee Iacocca, Ford’s General Manager, had always invisioned a small sports car to be the next hot item in the street wars. Ford decided that instead of improving their lackluster intermediate, they would do the competition one better and introduce a whole new breed of automobile, the pony car. Originally designed as a two seater in the European tradition, Iacocca realized that true success depended on volume sales. Therefore the Ford Mustang was introduced as a 1965 model that was based on the compact Falcon to lower production costs. It came with an obligatory back seat and a multitude of options that would give the buyer an opportunity to customize their purchase, and generate extra profits for Ford. Plymouth faithful stress that their Baracuda beat the Ford Mustang to market by two weeks. But it was the Mustang, which racked up over 22,000 sales its first day and one million sales in its first two years, that turned the market and people’s attention to the pony car. The pony car class that the Ford Mustang helped create is the only class of muscle car that still exists today.

1965 Ford Mustang

  The Ford Mustang debuted as a simple sports car powered by a 170 cid six cylinder and a pair of V8’s. Originally named for the fighter plane, the P-51 Mustang, preliminary allusions were made to the horse, and the horse motiff quickly became the emblem for the Mustang. Buyers loved its low price, long hood, short trunk styling, and its myriad of options. Ford loved its high volume sales and visibility. In mid 1964, Ford introduced a sporty 2+2 fastback body style to go along with the hardtop coupe and convertible. Enthusiasts also cheered the new “K-code” 271bhp 289 cid V8 that finally put some performance to match the Mustang’s good looks. For those that wanted more, the legendary Carroll Shelby and Ford collaborated to produce the Shelby GT-350, a Ford Mustang fastback specially tuned by Shelby. The 289 V8 produced 306bhp in street tune and around 360bhp in special GT-350R race tune. These Shelby’s had no back seat, were only available in white and were fully race ready.

  1966 saw further refinement of the Mustang. The gauge cluster was redone to seperate the Mustang from its Falcon roots while the 260 cid V8 was replaced with 2 and 4 barrel versions of the 289 cid V8. The Shelby GT-350 was still available, though its race image was being dilluted by the addition of an automatic transmission, a choice of four colors, and special examples that were prepared for Hertz Rent A Car (known as Shelby GT-350H) for rental to weekend drag racers. Available on the GT-350 through 1968 was a Paxton supercharger which would boost horsepower by as much as 40%.

  1967 saw a massive restyle of the Ford Mustang. Changes included bulkier sheet metal below the beltline, a more aggressive grille, a concave tail panel, and a full fastback roofline for the fastback body style. The engine compartment was also increased and Ford dropped in its big block 390 to compete against the new Chevrolet Camaro SS396. Although the 390 was slightly detuned for the Mustang, its popularity sealed the end of the high performance 289 cid engine, which was later dropped from the lineup. Of greater interest to enthusiasts was the availablitity of another Shelby-tuned Mustang. The GT350 was still powered by a modified 289 V8, though output dropped to 290bhp. The new GT500 was powered by a reworked 428 V8 (some were reportedly built with the even more powerful, race ready 427 V8). The 1967 Shelby’s were more civilized and sported numerous luxury options, which seemed to appeal to buyers. These would be the last Shelby Mustangs actually built by Shelby-American. All future models would be built by Ford with little Shelby involvement.

1968 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1968a

  The 1968 Ford Mustang received a simpler grille and side trim and a limited number of 427 engines were slipped into the engine bays. These 427 engines were slightly detuned but still cranked out 390bhp, enough to strike fear on the streets. Then on April 1, 1968, Ford unveiled perhaps its most famous line of engines, the 428 Cobra Jet. It was based on the regular 428 but included larger valve heads, the race 427’s intake manifold, and an oil-pan windage tray. It had ram-air induction and breathed through a functional hood scoop. Output was listed at 335bhp but was rumoured to be around 410bhp. The Shelby’s were still available, joined by an available convertible model and renamed the Shelby Cobra. The GT-350 dropped its 289 cid 306 bhp engine and gained a 302 cid 250 bhp engine. Midway through the year, the GT-500 was dropped and was replaced by the GT-500KR (“King of the Road”). The GT-500KR sported the new Ram Air 428 Cobra Jet, still underrated at 335 bhp.

1969 Ford Mustang



  The Mustang was restyled for 1969, gaining 3.8 inches of length, all ahead of the front wheels, and about 140 lbs in curb weight. The Mach 1 body style debuted in 1969 and came standard with a 351 cid V8 but could also be had with the 428 Cobra Jet, which now came in three states of tune. The first was a non-Ram Air version, followed by the Ram-Air version which breathed through a shaker hood scoop. Topping the list was the new Super Cobra Jet which came with the Drag Pack option. The Super Cobra Jet used the shaker hood scoop, a modified crankshaft and stronger connecting rods. The Drag Pack also came with limited-slip 3.91:1 or 4.30:1 rear axles and no air conditioning. All three engines were underrated at 335bhp. All this power overwhelmed the rear tires, which suffered from a 59/41% f/r bias which also hurt handling. But then, these Mustangs weren’t built for curves, just straight 1/4 mile lines.

The circle tracks were reserved for the Boss series of Mustangs. Named after stylist Larry Shinoda’s nickname for Ford president Semon “Bunkie” Knudson, the Boss Mustangs were built to qualify the 429 V8 for NASCAR. The Boss 429 package came with a race ready 429 cid V8 with ram air induction, an aluminum high riser and header type exhaust manifolds. Mandatory options included a four speed manual and a 3.91:1 Traction-Lok axle. Also included were an oil cooler, trunk mounted battery, race suspension, and the best interior Mustang had to offer. Although impressive on paper, the Boss 429s failed on the street where their dependence on high revs hurt their street starts and the initial batch had incorrect valve springs that would stop winding at 4500rpm instead of 6000rpm. Nevertheless, it had good handling and would last through 1970. To combat Chevrolet’s Camaro Z/28 in Trans Am racing, Ford built the Boss 302 which used a 302 cid V8 treated to the cylinder heads from the racing 351 cid engine and Ford’s largest carb. It was underrated at the same 290bhp as the Camaro Z/28’s engine and was available with the shaker hood scoop. Shelby Mustangs were still available, though they were more luxury oriented then ever before.

1970 Ford Mustang

  Both the Boss 302 and 429 continued into 1970. The 428 Cobra Jet continued as the top engine choice for the Mach 1 Mustang. New for 1970 was the 429 Cobra Jet, standard in the Boss 429. The 429 Cobra Jet was rated at 370 bhp while the Super Cobra Jet was rated for 375 bhp. This would be the last year for the Shelby Cobras, which were in fact left over 1969 models with some minor trim changes. A not so great end for a once great performer.

1971 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1971a

  Ford’s decade of “Total Performance” was drawing to a close. The Mustang grew by 2.1″ of length, 2.8″ of width, 1″ of wheelbase, and about 100 lbs. Coupled with this weight gain was the disappearance of the Shelby models and the Boss 302 and Boss 429 models, and the weakening of the remaining engine choices. The 351 engine was detuned from 300 bhp to 285bhp while the 429 Cobra Jet dropped 5bhp to 370bhp. The performance banner was carried by the Mach 1 Mustang and the new Boss 351 model. The standard engine for the Mach 1 was the 351 Cleveland V8 with 285bhp but a 330bhp version was also available. The 429 Cobra Jet sported 370bhp while the top power choice was was the 429 Super Cobra Jet Ram Air. It had 11.3:1 compression, and generated 375bhp but its 1/4 mile times were slower than the Boss 351. The Boss 351 enjoyed a lower weight and a race bred 351 engine that had a radical solid-lifter cam, 11.0:1 compression, ram-air induction and came with a Hurst four-speed transmission and 3.91:1 Traction-Lok differential. This would be its only season as Ford performance would continue to decrease.

1972 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1972a

  Following industry lead, all power ratings for 1972 and later were listed in net ratings which included all accessories. This lead to some drastic drops in power listings which, coupled with the drop of all big block options, sealed the end of Ford Mustang performance. The Boss 351 was dropped leaving only the Mach 1 with any claim to performance. The top engine option was just a 275bhp 351 Cleveland.

  All engine choices’ power ratings dropped again as emission controls tightened. New federal guidelines resulted in mandatory bumpers that could withstand a 5mph collision, all of which didn’t help the bloated styling. The top engine option was a weak 351 V8 producing just 156bhp and the performance oriented Ford Mustang would fade away as the restyled Mustang II would debut in 1974 with no claim to any performance.

History: Second Generation
1974 – 1978

Introduction: The second generation Mustang, called the Mustang II, was an attempt to get back to the light, sporty car of the mid 1960s, modeled after European competitors. Instead, the Second Generation Mustang failed miserably, and ended up as a truly underpowered shadow of its former self. Perhaps no other car best examplifies what was wrong with performance in the 1970s than the Mustang II.

1974 Ford Mustang II

ford-mustang-1974a

  Answering the call for a lighter, more nimble Mustang, Ford’s Lee Iacocca, dictated that the new Mustang, officially called the Mustang II, which debuted in 1974 would be light, sporty, and more European. Iacocca wanted it to be “a little jewel” and this direction drove every aspect of the new design. Under this new direction, V8s were declared too heavy, and thus the Mustage II was powered by a new 2.3 liter 4-cylinder engine or a 2.5 liter V6. The 2.3 4-cylinder engine was the first Ford 4 cylinder engine since the last Model B in 1934, and the first metric engine built in the U.S. It was losely based on the Ford of Europe’s 2.0 liter Cortina engine, although it was so extensively modified that only the nuts and bolts could be shared. The 2.3 liter engine featured an overhead camshaft within its iron heads and was topped by a two-barrel Weber-Holley carbureator which fed fuel through an aluminum intake manifold. The engine was rated at a rather weak 102 bhp. The optional 2.8 liter V6 was a slightly enlarged version of the Capri’s optional 2.5 liter V6 and was rated at a marginally better 119 bhp. This was a far cry from the 275 bhp 351 Cleveland V8 available in the Mustang just two years before. The Mustang was now based on the Pinto chassis, which was not a performance car by any stretch of the imagination. The chassis was heavily modified to give it more of a luxury feel, “mini-limousine” as Iacocca wanted it. The Mustang II was a foot shorter than the original 1965 Mustang and just 300 lbs. heavier, but weight distribution was still horrible with 58% of the weight over the front of the car. It was offered in four-cylinder Mach 1 or “mini-limousine” Ghia form. Ford expected it to be a huge success. It wasn’t. Only 18,000 were sold the first month, compared to 22,000 on the first day back in 1964. Performance was dismal, with the V6 needing almost 14 seconds to hit 60 mph and almost 20 seconds to go through the quarter mile. But the Mustang II was saved by the OPEC oil shortage of 1974. Long lines and high prices for gasoline drove up sales of the more fuel efficient Mustang II’s.

 <br/> Production:
Engines: 2.3 liter I4 102 bhp @ 5200 rpm. 2.8 liter V6 119 bhp @ 5200 rpm.
Performance: 2.8 V6/119: 0-60 in 13.8 seconds, 1/4 mile in 19.4 seconds @ 70.5 mph.

1975 Ford Mustang II

ford-mustang-1975a

  The biggest boost for the Mustang II’s image was the introduction of the 302 cubic inch V8 back to the Mustang option list. Available in any Mustang II, but only with an automatic transmission, the V8 was topped by a two-barrel Autolite carb and was rated at 134 bhp. The Mach 1 was also enhanced with an optional Rallye suspension package which offered adjustable Gabriel shock absorbers, stiffer springs, and larger-diameter anti-sway bars, all of which improved handling. But just when some semblance of performance reappeared for the Mustang, the Federal Government stepped in to spoil the fun. The Federal Government instituted the new Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard which mandated that all automanufacturers had to achieve a certain average fuel economy among the vehicles that they built. This necessitated building high fuel economy cars to balance out gas guzzlers. Because of this, Ford released a MPG (Miles Per Gallon) version of its Mustang II with a 3.18:1 rear axle (instead of the standard 3.40:1) and fitted with a standard catalytic converter (which was required on all cars sold in California to reduce emissions). Fuel economy was quoted as 23/34 City/Highway, which was pretty decent for the times.

 <br/> Production:
Engines: 2.3 liter I4 102 bhp @ 5200 rpm. 2.8 liter V6 119 bhp @ 5200 rpm. 302 V8 134 bhp @ 3600 rpm, 247 lb-ft @ 1800.
Performance: 302 V8: 0-60 in 10.5 seconds, 1/4 mile in 17.9 seconds @ 77 mph.

1976 Ford Mustang II

ford-mustang-1976a

  Catalytic converters were made standard on all Mustang IIs for 1976 as Federal emission laws were tightened. The 302 V8 was now available with the manual transmission, and a new Cobra II appearance package was available, through a partnership with Motortown Corporation, an outside vendor, although enthusiast magazines trashed it because it came with the four cylinder engine as standard. Still, careful selection off the option sheet could build you a decent little performer, just like the glory days.

Engines: 2.3 liter I4 102 bhp @ 5200 rpm. 2.8 liter V6 119 bhp @ 5200 rpm. 302 V8 134 bhp @ 3600 rpm, 247 lb-ft @ 1800.
Performance: 302 V8: 0-60 in 10.5 seconds, 1/4 mile in 17.9 seconds @ 77 mph.

1977 Ford Mustang II

  The only change for 1977 was that production of the Cobra II option was now done in-house by Ford.

  1978 saw the introduction of the King Cobra Mustang II. The King Cobra package was offered only with the four-speed manual transmission and featured a better suspension with front and rear stabilizer bars, the 302 V8 with a Variable Venturi Carbureator, Goodyear P195/70R13 radial tires, and a wild paint and graphics appearance package. Most King Cobras were built in Bright Red, although technically any regular Mustang II color was available. The King Cobra package (at a cost of $1,277) pushed the price of a Mustang II from a base of $4,088 to over $6,800. To add to the excitement, Ford also teamed up with Monroe Shocks to create a total of eight show cars, known collectively as the “Monroe Handler.” Featuring wild custom bodywork and numerous handling upgrades, these show cars generated a great deal of excitement for the Mustang II. But this would be the last year for the Mustang II. An all new Mustang was to debut in 1979, modeled after Volkswagen’s Rabbit. Appropriately, it would be Ford’s fox.

History: Third Generation
1979 – 1993

Introduction: The third generation Mustang was built on the new global “Fox” platform which would form the basis of future Mustangs well into the next century.

1979 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1979a

  1979 saw the debut of the new Mustang (the “II” was dropped) based on the new Fox platform. Compared to the 1978 Mustang II, the new Mustang was 4.1 inches longer, with a 4.2 inch longer wheelbase, yet weighed nearly 200 lbs. less. The Mustang was available in either two door coupe or three door hatchback models, as well as an upgraded trim and appearance Ghia trim. Three suspension setups were available with the top of the line Special Suspension package including retuned shock absorber valving, front and rear springs, and front and rear stabilizer bars along with metric sized cast-aluminum wheels and, for the first time on a Mustang, non-US tires (Michelin TRX performance radial tires). Lessor Mustangs had to make do with other radial or bias-ply tires. Despite the improved suspension, handling still suffered from the 60/40% weight distribution when equiped with the heavy 302 V8. A total of six engines were available, from the carryover 2.3 liter I4 now producing a mere 88 bhp up, a new 200 cubic inch (3.3 liter) 85 bhp I6 to the now 10 year old carryover 302 V8. A new turbo-charged 2.3 liter I4 was introduced which was rated at 143 bhp and its lighter weight gave the Mustang better weight balance than the heavy 302 V8. But the turbo was a mixed blessing. It generated more horsepower than the old tech V8, but there was substantial turbo lag which hurt driveability and performance. The Turbo engines also suffered from oil lubrication problems that caused some turbos to fail and others to ignite(!) Clearly, the Turbo Charged engine was not quite perfected yet. A Cobra package was available which included the Turbo Charged I4, TRX tires and wheels, and additional trim items. Also available was a new “flip-up, open-air roof” which was the closest thing to a convertible available in 1979. The Mustang was picked to pace the Indy 500 race for 1979, and Ford celebrated by producing about 11,000 Indy Pace Car Replicas which featured outlandish decals and functional Recaro reclining bucket seats.

1980 Ford Mustang

  For 1980, the Cobra option now included the Recaro seats. But this couldn’t make up for the loss under the hood. In order to comply with CAFE standards, the 302 V8 was de-bored down to 255 cubic inches, reducing power from 134 bhp to 119 bhp.

1981 Ford Mustang

  The 2.8 liter V6 was dropped for 1981, with the 3.3 liter V6 receiving a slight boost in power up to 91 bhp. The Turbo Charged I4 continued and was still the standard engine in the Cobra package, although buyers could substitute the 255 V8 as a $144 credit. But by the end of the model year, the Turbo Charged engine was dropped (due to nagging realibility problems) and the V8 became the standard engine in the Cobra. Midyear, Ford introduced a four-speed plus overdrive (effectively five speed) manual transmission. This transmission could be hooked up to a new Traction-Lok rear axle, which was a limited slip differential that was vastly improved from its late 1960’s iterations and finally was able to somewhat control axle hop and wheel spin. The 1979 Replica T-Top option was brought back, which led to some aftermarket convertible conversions. Ford didn’t seem to notice (or care) about this pent up demand for Mustang convertibles.

  Performance fans finally were rewarded in 1982 with the reintroduction of the beloved 302 V8, now named the 5.0 liter HO (High Output) and rated at a decent 157 bhp. In addition, the GT package came back and was available in either red, black, or metallic silver paint and featured spoilers and a large (cosmetic) hood scoop. Two door coupes got more pronounced B-pillars and were now formally known as two door sedans. The Ghia model name was dropped and replaced with L, GL, GLX, and the GT package. Base prices started at $6,345 and could top $6,000 for a fully loaded GT.

  The convertible finally returned for 1983. All Mustangs also received a redesigned grille and taillights. In addition, engine choices were shuffled up, mainly for the better. The 3.3 I6 was dropped, and replaced with a new 3.8 liter V6 rated at 112 bhp. The 2.3 liter I4 Turbo Charged engine returned, completely reworked and more reliable due to the use of electronic fuel injection, and was rated at 145 bhp. But the big news was the replacement of the old two-barrel carb on the 5.0 liter V8 with a new four barrel Holley carb which resulted in 175 bhp. To handle this power, GT models used 205/70R14 tires in place of the previous 185/75R14s.

  To mark the 20th anniversary of the Mustang, Ford released a special Twentieth Anniversary GT model. This featured a GT350 badge were it had been 19 years before. Unfortunately, although Carrol Shelby had licensed the Cobra name to Ford, the GT350 and GT500 names were not licensed. Ford had to discontinue using the GT350 name, making this a one year only model. The 20th Anniversary GT was offered with either the turbocharged inline 4 or the 5.0 liter H.O. All cars were Oxford White with Canyon Red stripes. A total of 5,260 20th Anniversary GTs were built, of which 3,333 were V8 coupes, 1,213 were V8 convertibles, 350 were I4 turbo coupes, and a mere 104 were I4 turbo convertibles. Both the 3.8 liter V6 and the 5.0 liter V8 H.O. replaced their carbs with a new throttle-body electronic fuel injection system. Although power for the H.O. engine dropped from 175 bhp to 165 bhp, everything else improved from cold starting, to throttle response, to fuel economy. Eager to rebuild its performance image, Ford introduced its Mustang SVO for midway through the model year as a 1984 1/2 model. Named for its Special Vehicle Operations unit, the SVO Mustang was designed with performance in mind. Available only as a Black three door hatchback, the SVO came with a modified 2.3 liter Turbocharged Inline 4 with a new intercooler for the turbo which raised power from 145 bhp to a stout 174 bhp. The SVO was quite a performer as the improved Turbocharged engine was coupled to Ford’s Traction-Lok differential and a final drive ratio of 3.45:1, which gave it decent acceleration. Visually, SVOs could be identified by their unique bi-level rear spoilers, their hood scoop, and the “drooped” nose that incorporated no grille. All cooling air was taken from openings below the front bumper. In addition, the SVO Mustang featured a perfected four-bar link rear suspension system. For hard core enthusiasts, a special option, 41C, was available which not only deleted the radio, but also removed the power door locks, power windows, and air conditioning, saving the buyer $1,253 and nearly 100 lbs. compared to the regular SVOs.

1985 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1985a

  The big news for 1985 was improvements to the 5.0 liter V8 H.O. The engine received true dual exhausts, and 1960s era stainless steel tube headers. Along with a longer duration lift cam and hydraulic roller valve lifters, power output increased to a respectable 210 bhp.
The SVO continued into 1985, now in Dark Charcoal Gray instead of Black and new flush-mounted halogen headlights which improved visual appeal. New P225/60VR16 Goodyear Gatorback tires and a new 3.73:1 rear axle ratio shaved nearly half a second in the quarter mile and raised trap speed by 4 mph. The steering ratio was improved from 20:1 to 15:1, and the price dropped slightly. But the big news was the introduction mid-year, of a newly improved Turbo Charged I4 with an increased boost (from 14 psi to 15 psi), dual exhausts, and a wilder camshaft, which resulted in a power increase to 205 bhp.

1986 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1986a

  The regular turbo charged I4 was dropped for 1986, while the SVO engine was slightly detuned for 1986, its last year, to meet the requirements of lower octane gas. A total of 9,842 SVOs were sold over the three year period, less than the first year target of 10,000. Although it helped the Mustang’s performance image, its marginally better performance didn’t justify the almost $4,000 price premium over a Mustang GT. And it never got the European car shoppers that were its original target.

  There was a significant restyling for 1987. Although the SVO Mustangs were gone, a lot of their parts found their way to lesser Mustangs. All Mustangs received the SVO drooped nose, and thus all radiator breathing was from under the front bumper. Headlights were changed to the former SVOs aero-headlamps with halogen bulbs. In addition, GTs now came with the SVO’s quad-shock rear axle suspension as standard equipment. Ford perfected its electronic fuel injection (EFI) system on the 5.0 V8, resulting in a gain to 225 bhp. The 3.8 liter V6 was dropped, leaving a significant gap between the entry level 4 cylinder engine and the V8. A five speed manual transmission was standard on all models. Visually, the GT differed from the base LX model with multilouvered taillights, front and rear air dams, and side-aerodynamic valence with scoops to front and rear brakes. The former three door sedans were now called two door hatchbacks.

In addition, Ford created a special run of 2,000 Emerald Green GT Convertibles with white leather interiors that it refered to as the Limited Edition Twenty-Fifth Anniversary model (evidently forgeting that the Mustang’s 25th anniversary was in 1989). It was quite successful and a total of 3,837 were built.

  For 1993, Ford released three limited edition Mustangs: A yellow LX 5.0L convertible with white interior (1,419 produced), and a white on white convertible (1,460 produced) were available from the beginning of the year. A new Cobra model was introduced mid-year with its 5.0 liter V8 tweaked to 235 bhp, while changes to the SAE rating method dropped the regular 5.0 V8 to 200 bhp. The Cobra was produced by Ford’s Special Vehicles Team (SVT) which had taken over the functions of the former SVO group. The Cobra benefited from engine improvements developed by Ford tuner Jack Roush, as well as huge 245/45ZR17 Goodyear Eagle tires on 17″ wheels. Performance was good and a remarkable 4,993 cars were sold in just half a year. Although the Cobra injected some excitement in the Mustang lineup, the basic design had been unchanged for 14 years. But big things were in the works for 1994.

History: Fourth Generation
1994 – 2003

Introduction: The fourth generation Mustang would keep soldiering on its outdated Fox platform, until it was the last Pony car standing.

1994 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1994a

  The Mustang debuted with an all new body for 1994, but was still based on the old Fox platform. The wheelbase grew 0.8 inches to 101.3 inches, while the front and rear track increased on the GT. Four wheel disc brakes were standard, with anti-lock brakes optional on both the GT and the base model car. The base car was now powered by a new 3.8 liter V6 which replaced the previous 2.3 I4. Using a number of aluminum components, it was almost as light as the much smaller four cylinder engine. The 5.0 V8 was given better breathing and output increased to 215 bhp. A five speed manual transmission was standard, and a four speed automatic was optional for both engines. Traction-Lok was also available. In pursuit of greater structural rigidity, the hatchback model was dropped, leaving only the two door coupe and convertible. The coupe’s roof line was designed to resemble a hardtop option for the convertible that was never produced. At the top was a new Cobra model with a 245 bhp version of the 5.0 V8. Once again, the Mustang was chosen to be the pace car at the Indy 500, and approximately 1,000 replica models were sold. Much more limited were the 250 Cobra R models sold by Ford’s SVT unit. These were delivered without air conditioning, radio, and much of the insulation, and were designed to be sold to race car drivers. Quite a few ended up on the streets, however.

1995 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1995a

  Ford tightened the reins on the Cobra R for 1995, requiring buyers to show a competition license in order to buy one. Available only in Crystal White, Cobra R models came a racing fuel cell and a special engine cooling package, but with no power windows, insulation, radio, or back seat. Buyers were expected to install their own competition racing seats within their own roll cages. Delivery weight was a mere 3,325 lbs. The biggest news was that the engine had been prepped by Jack Roush Technologies. The 351 Windsor V8 was rated at a stout 300 bhp and all Cobra Rs received a Tremec five speed manual transmission, a final drive ratio of 3.27:1, a revised suspension, and P255/45R17 BF Goodrich Comp T/A tires mounted on huge 17″x9.0″ wheels.

Lessor Mustangs continued with either the 3.8 V6 or the 5.0 V8. 1995 would be the last year of the fabled “5.0” V8.

1996 Ford Mustang

ford-mustang-1996a

  The 5.0 liter V8 that had been a Mustang trademark for over 20 years was finally discontinued (although it would still live on in the Ford Explorer SUV). In its place was a much more modern 4.6 liter V8 rated at the same 225 bhp. The 3.8 liter V6 carryover from the year before. The Mustang Cobra received a heavily massaged and completely modern 4.6 V8 that was rated at a stout 305 bhp. Cobra’s also received Ford’s “Mystic” paint which looked black in dim light, but changed to different colors in the sun.
