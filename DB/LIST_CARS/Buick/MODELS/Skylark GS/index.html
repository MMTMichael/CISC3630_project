						(1953-1954 & 1961-1972)

Introduction: The Buick Skylark first appeared as a limited production model in 1953 and 1954, when it disappeared. It would reappear in 1961 and serve as the basis for the mighty Buick GS line.
<br/>
1953 Buick Skylark

  The first Skylark helped commemorate Buick’s 50th anniversary. Built as a limited edition (1,690 units) model off of the Roadmaster line, it was distinctly unique. The Skylark was only available as a convertible and the Harley Earl designed model spoke of class and performance. The body design made it look lower than a standard convertible. There were no ventiports (known as “port holes”) that were a standard feature on other Buick models. The windshield was laid over, and the wheelwells were opened up considerably. A body-length strip swept from the front fender down to the front base of the rear wheelwell, then outlined the front of the wheelwell before ending at the taillights. Distinctive Skylark badges were located just ahead of the rear wheelwells. The leather interior was luxurious with ribbed inserts and the Skylark came with numerous standard luxury features. Borrani chrome forty-spoke wheels completed the look. The Skylark also was the first Buick to showcase its new engine, a 322 cid V8 with a four barrel carb, and an 8.5:1 compression ratio, which was rated at 188 bhp. This engine pushed the 4,315 lb. Skylark from 0-60 in about 12 seconds and to a top speed of 105 mph. This is arguably one of the most collectible and valuable Buicks ever made.

<br/>
1954 Buick Skylark

  The Skylark was again a limited production model for 1954, with only 836 made. The Skylark received a new distinctive rear end which featured unique chrome tailfins that contained the taillights, a styling feature never seen before. The rear styling was accentuated by a pair of ridges that ran parallel down the rear trunk lid. The backup lights were mounted on the outside and midway up the rear deck. The chrome wire wheels, by Kelsey-Hayes, were again in place along with a distinctive emblem located just forward of the rear wheel cutout. The rear wheelwells were opened up considerably aft of the wheels. Reportedly, the open areas were sometimes painted red at the factory. The 322 cid V8 continued, although output was increased to 200 bhp. The Dynaflow transmission was standard with a 3.40:1 rear end. The Skylark name vanished after 1954, only to reappear in 1961.

Interestingly, the top engine was now refered to just as the 350 cid four-barrel carb V8, instead of its previous “High Performance V8” name.
